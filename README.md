## 💡 About the Exam Task

The exam task was to build a small voting system where students could:
- Log in using their student ID
- Nominate fellow students
- Vote once and leave an anonymous comment
- See the top nominee and comments
- Ensure validation rules (e.g. no voting twice, can’t nominate yourself)

The project applies core object-oriented principles and uses a MySQL database connection.

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Run the provided SQL files to set up `studentDB` and `voteDB`
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or another Java IDE)
3. Run `Main.java`
4. Use test student IDs from the SQL data to log in and interact

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Aggregation
- Modular structure with packages (e.g. `student`, `database`, `Nominerte`)
- Input validation and database interaction using JDBC

## 📁 Files

- `/src` – all source code files (organized in packages)
- `/sql` – SQL files to initialize databases
- `README.md` – this file
